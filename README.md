# Guided Project: Asteroids the Game

This project aims to highlight principles of the following lessons:

* Python: Multiple module project (VSCode).
* Object Orientated Programming.

This project uses pygame 2.6.0 as a base for most of the core structure. The project has two 
phases. 

Phase 1 - Player: All modules and code that sets up the game window and the player 
sprite/movement.

Phase 2 - Asteroids: All modules and code that sets up the Asteroids, Player attacking, Asteroid
'physics' (Breaking, Splitting, Collision).
